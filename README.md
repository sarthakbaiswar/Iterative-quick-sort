# Iterative-quick-sort
Iterative implementation of Iterative Quick sort in C

AIM:  Write a C program to include non-recursive routines to implement a quick sort.
      It would be desirable if the pivot position is decided by user.
      Include basic utility routines to create and display the list.
      
The quickiter.c is the main file.
The quickiter.h consists of the non-recursive routines to implement quick sort.
The arr_quick.h includes consists code for basic utilities to create and display the list.

Here, the non-recursive routines have been implemented using stack.
